# SAINT , 18 it/its

**I like..** FNAF, metal gear, trigun, unstable universe, golden kamuy, the walking dead and many other things. Psychology and physiology are my biggest interests.

**Do Not interact** if you're under 15, *fakeclaim systems** or if you're extremely chronically online. It's the internet. Don't interact with me if you enjoy [incest/lolicon/shotacon/rape] in fiction (and reality, obviously) either.

**I don't care if you think most DID/OSDD-1 systems on the internet are faking. Go outside, go get a job. Worry about your own life, and not others.*
